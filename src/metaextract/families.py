"""Analysis families: the per-record field set is data, not hard-coded UI.

Different meta-analysis designs need different numbers per record. A *continuous
two-arm* design (treatment-vs-control means) wants mean/SD/n per arm — what feeds
a log response ratio or Hedges' g. A *binary two-arm* design (e.g. odds/risk
ratio) wants events/total per arm instead. The family is the single knob a task
pack sets (``analysis_family``); everything downstream — the cockpit input form,
the slot roles, the export columns — is generated from the family's field list,
so supporting a new design means adding a family here, never editing the cockpit
by hand.

Only ``continuous_two_arm`` is validated on a real corpus (the soil/land-use
papers P1-P12). The others are structurally supported but UNTESTED on real
papers; see the README. Keep that honesty: a family existing here is not a claim
that locate/extract was ever measured for it.
