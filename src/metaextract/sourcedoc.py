"""Addressable source document — the bbox-carrying foundation of the cockpit.

Architecture v3.1 §3/§4 (C1): the cockpit's make-or-break feature is
*click a slot → jump to the exact spot in the PDF and highlight it*. That only
works if geometry comes from **deterministic ingest**, never from the LLM. The
Tier-2 locator later picks a ``block_id`` from this document; it does not invent
a location.

Two levels of geometry, both from PyMuPDF:

* **blocks** — paragraph / figure regions (and, as it happens, each *row* of a
  borderless journal table arrives as its own block). The jump target.
* **words** — every token with its own bbox. The *precise highlight* target: to
  confirm ``mean_t = 0.392`` we light up that one number, not a whole cell.

Word-level addressing replaces the cell-grid idea from v3.0: ``find_tables()``
reliably returns nothing on borderless journal tables (no ruling lines), so a
deterministic cell grid is not obtainable — but every number still has an exact
word bbox, which is what verification actually needs.

Coordinates are PDF points (1/72 inch), origin top-left, y increasing downward.
``SourceDoc.page_sizes`` lets a viewer scale bboxes to any render resolution.
