"""Tier 1 screen + Tier 2 locate (Architecture v3.1 §2, §7).

The locator is handed the *already-addressed* blocks of a :class:`SourceDoc` and
asked to do two cheap, low-error-cost jobs:

1. **Screen** the paper — include/exclude, which target variables and moderators
   are present (paper level only; never bound to a record, v3.1 §2).
2. **Locate** — for each target variable, name the ``block_id`` that contains it.
   It returns NO numbers and does NO treatment/control pairing.

The critical-path invariant (C1): the model may only *choose a block_id that
already exists*; all geometry (page, bbox) is attached afterwards from the
SourceDoc by :func:`resolve_regions`. A block_id the model invents is dropped and
reported, never given fabricated coordinates. ``build_payload`` and
``resolve_regions`` are pure and unit-tested without the API; :func:`locate` is a
thin Gemini wrapper around them.
